# quiz-game-tutorial
This is a tutorial on how to create a simple quiz game while learning c++ and ncurses, as well as various GNU utilities such as getopt.
It will guide you through several distinct parts, each incrementally adding features.

Project goals:
- to demonstrate proper software design practices (using the UNIX philosophy)
- to show and utilize the power of [ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/)
- to demonstrate the use of [GNU getopt](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html)
- to learn a bit of history while we're here
- to collect quality, fleshed-out [question sets](questions)
- to inspire and create a launch platform for others' future projects
- to create an entertaining and educational final product for others to use and enjoy


## Usage
This tutorial series is meant to be read in sequence, with the reader programming as we go along.
Each part of the tutorial series is an individual project - you can ```make``` and run it if you wish.  All source code is provided.

Of course, there are many different ways of solving almost any programming task.  
Therefore, it is recommended that the reader attempt to first skim through a tutorial, then attempt to implement the content in their own style.  
The provided source code is by no means "perfect", and is intended as a guide.
